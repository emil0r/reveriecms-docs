= reverie.logger

Logger takes two parameters. Logger is dependant on https://github.com/ptaoussanis/timbre[timbre].

- prod?, which decided whether to initiate the other appenders
- appenders, which is a map with appender options


== Example config in settings.edn

```clojure
{:log {:appenders {:rotor {:path "logs/reverie.log"}
                   :postal {:from "root@reverie"
                            :to "user@example.com"
                            :settings {:user "log@example.com"
                                       :pass "password"
                                       :ssl true
                                       :host "smtp.example.com"}}}}}
```


== Adding new appender

Add a new defmethod to the `multimethod get-appender` in `reverie.logger`. 
It takes one argument in the form of a `[k v]` vector from the map of appenders 
being sent in and is dispatched on the k value. Look in the code for specifics.
