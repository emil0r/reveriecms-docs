# Templates

A template defines the HTML for a page and defines the areas within the template. Conceptually templates in reverie don't fullfill the role of content holders. That job is left for objects and apps. Typically a template instead defines the general structure of a HTML page and defines areas inside the template into which content can be put

Templates are always used by the reverie.page/Page implementation and can be used by both the reverie.page/AppPage and reverie.page/RawPage implementations.

reverie uses https://github.com/weavejester/hiccup[hiccup] as default for HTML rendering.


```clojure
(ns some-namespace
  (:require [hiccup.page :refer [html5]]
            [reverie.core :refer [deftemplate]]))

;; define a template function. return anything that is ring compatible
(defn main-template [request page properties params]
  (html5
    [:head
      [:title "my main template"]]
    [:body
      "body"]))

;; define a template main and tell reverie to use the
;; function main-template for the template
(deftemplate main main-template)
```
